This is my portfolio website contains all my projects. If those are web based projects in javascript processing library p5js they are rendered in house, but for projects in other languages I am still in the process of searching and learning how I can port them to webassembly (I think this is great but I know nothing about it except for it can convert rust and c++ programs to ecmascripts which is very cool because I like c++ more than js).

Made with vite buildsystem, in react using a lot of tailwind css and it is responsive!!! which wasn't very fun to execute.

It is inspired by norse mythology...
